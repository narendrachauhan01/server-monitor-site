              To use the Service you must register with a valid full name, email address, and mobile
              phone number. Registration requires OTP (one-time password) verification to confirm
              your mobile number. Providing false or inaccurate information is a violation of these
              Terms and may result in immediate account termination.

              You must be at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> to create an account. By

            <p>
              UptimeForge accepts payments <strong>exclusively via UPI (Unified Payments Interface)</strong>,
              India's government-regulated instant payment system. We do not accept credit cards,
              debit cards, net banking, international payments, or cryptocurrency of any kind.
              Accepted UPI applications include PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, BHIM, Amazon Pay,
              and any other standard UPI-compatible app.

            <p>
              To activate your 5-day free trial, a <strong>one-time, non-refundable ₹2 UPI
              payment</strong> is required at registration. This fee:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Verifies that your UPI account is active and operational</li>

              <li>Activates your 5-day full-access free trial</li>
            </ul>

              all circumstances, including if you do not use the trial or decide not to continue.
            </p>

            <h3>4.3 Subscription Plans and Pricing</h3>
            <p>
              After the free trial, continued access requires a monthly subscription. Current pricing:

              <strong>30 days in advance</strong> of any price increases.
            </p>

            <h3>4.4 Plan Activation Timeline</h3>
            <p>
              After a payment request is submitted, your plan will be activated within{' '}
              <strong>24 hours</strong> following manual verification of your UPI transaction by our
              team. Activation may be delayed on public holidays and weekends. You will receive an
              email confirmation once your plan is active.
            </p>

            <h3>4.5 No Auto-Renewal — No Standing Instructions</h3>
            <p>
              UptimeForge does <strong>NOT</strong> set up any auto-debit mandates, recurring UPI
              instructions, or automatic renewals. You will never be charged without initiating a
              payment yourself. Your plan will simply expire at the end of the billing period and you
              can choose to renew manually. You will receive a reminder email before your plan expires.
            </p>

            <h3>4.6 Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              The ₹2 trial verification fee is <strong>strictly non-refundable</strong>. For monthly
              subscription payments, refunds are not provided for the current billing month or any
              unused portion of a plan. If you believe a payment was made in error (e.g., duplicate
              payment), contact us at{' '}
              <a href={`mailto:${CONTACT_EMAIL}`}>{CONTACT_EMAIL}</a> within{' '}
              <strong>7 days</strong> of the transaction with your UPI transaction reference number
              (UTR). We will review such requests on a case-by-case basis.

              We target <strong>99.9% uptime</strong> for our monitoring infrastructure and make
              commercially reasonable efforts to maintain reliable service. However, we do not provide
              a guaranteed Service Level Agreement (SLA). The Service may be unavailable due to:

            <ul>
              <li>Scheduled maintenance (communicated in advance where possible)</li>

              Platform downtime does not automatically entitle users to refunds, service credits, or
